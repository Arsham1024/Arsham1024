## About
I'm a Computer Science graduate from California Polytechnic State University, Pomona (CPP). 

Currently working as a researcher at <a href='https://www.cpp.edu/faculty/santanamarin/projects.shtml' target="_blank">CALSys Labs</a> under the supervision of Dr.Ericsson Marin. My work focuses on building a cyberinfrastructure that scrapes malicious hacker data from the deep web and the dark web to produce cyber-threat intelligence models. I also build ML models to predict software vulnerabilities. 

Currently, I am excited to be working on a paper to publish soon on my research.
